1. The project should create daily log files for:
   - Each charging station
   - Each energy source
   - The whole system

2. Log file names should follow the pattern: <equipment_name>_<date>.log

3. The user should be able to search for log files by:
   - Equipment name
   - Date (in the format `yyyyMMdd`)

4. The project should include:
   - Byte and character streams for simulating data exchange
   - Metadata management for log files (create, move, delete, archive)

5. The project should handle potential exceptions like file creation failure, input/output errors, and empty directories.

6. The program should be structured with clear role distribution among team members.

7. The project should be hosted on GitHub, with a well-documented README and a .gitignore file to avoid unnecessary files.
